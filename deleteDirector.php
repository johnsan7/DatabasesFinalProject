<!--This deletes directors from the director table-->
<?php

/*Andrew Johnson, Databases Oregon State University
This code was largely from Justin Wolfords lecture on PHP and HTML from http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/winter2013/cs275-400/vlogger.php?video=RealCodingHTMLProject and
https://oregonstate.adobeconnect.com/_a827349107/p2ql0wxir68/?launcher=false&fcsContent=true&pbMode=normal

Changes were made as necessary for the specific operations peformed, but basic code syntax was taken from those lectures.
